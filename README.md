# Dynamic-Scroll-And-Load
We very often see the dynamic loading of new contents on the web pages as a user scrolls to the end. This project demonstrates a similar behavior by loading the new data to the web page as a user goes to the bottom of the page. When a user reaches toward the end of the web page, an AJAX request is sent to fetch data. A predefined template is then used to display the updated content on the web page.

As the project uses AJAX for acquiring new data, you are first required to host the project on the local server using software like XAMPP, Abyss, etc.
